It's not as hard as a foreign language is for me, with the language thankfully still being english. But at the same time it is incredibly challenging to try and remember all of the different types of things I needs tot remember to potentially use, as well as being incredibly creative as well. I feel like you have to be incredibly creative at times when coding, which can suck at times because I'm usually better at learning things in a linear formant at times. 

One thing that has surprised me though is how simple some things have been at times. As creative and complex as it can get, just stepping back, taking a break, and coming back to a problem has allowed me to see how simple some solutions to fixing/writing some code can be. By always seeing such complex and confusing code (at least for a beginner), I at times forget that programmers are humans too; humans who will always try to find the easiest and simplest way to do something just like the rest of us.","return(glide)
